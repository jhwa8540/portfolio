                Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that travels from one destination to another without the aid or control of a human being. This is achieved using an Artificial intelligence with the ability to use radars, cameras and sensors etc that will allow it to make responsible judgements.
                </p>
                <p>
                However, despite the concept of AI’s and autonomous vehicles being old, this technology is fairly new and is being developed in hopes of becoming a viable form of transport in the future (approximately 10~35 years). Currently Autonomous Cars are being developed by companies such as Google, UBER, Tesla, and many more.

                <p>
                We were assigned to design a User-Centred Interface compatible for these Autnomous Vehicles in the future, making them more accessible for the community.

                <p>Due to the scarceness of Autonomous Vehicles we had to look into transports that provide a similar experience to that of an Autonomous Vehicles. Hence we looked into services in which users can move from A to B without user intervention. Examples of this were Trains and Taxis.</p>

                  A stakeholder profile was created To narrow down the target audience and focus on the main users we created a Stakeholder profile placing our main users at the centre and additional internal and external influencers around the outer circles. This map showed which groups needed to gain attention compared to others giving priority to those that are closer to the centre in which our design will affect and those along the edges who we may focus less on.

                  UBER is an app that connects users to nearby uber drivers to take them wherever they want. 
                  This mobile app allows users to request a trip and pay online and offers users a cheaper alternative to a taxi. 

                  Due to this relatively cheap transport it is popular amongst younger consumers ranging from ages 16~34(young adults) which totals to 65% of UBER users. 

                  Uber was favoured more than a taxi not only because it was substantially cheaper but provided the users with the approximate cost which would be paid before-hand and the approximate time of travel, which solved the major issues of obscurity behind taxi services.

In addition to this, our online research provides insight on how autonomous cars can be utilised, and the consequences of implementing such technology. 
                Based off these research and findings we created concept sketches in the form of a wireframe of potential interfaces for users to connect them with Autonomous Cars.

                <p>It is widely known that alcohol can inhibit a person’s ability to reason, and thus it makes getting home in the late hours risky. As young adults are concerned whether or not there is transportation available for them to travel from the bar to get home safely.

                <p>
                  A smartphone app designed to keep intoxicated people off the roads and to get home safely by allowing them to call an autonomous car and identifying their location so they can be picked up. Users can set the meeting point, time of picked up and will receive a notification for when it is time for them to leave and by doing so will not have to worry about how they will get home safely after drinking. The app works by having the user plan ahead before they are drunk so that the intoxication will not hinder their ability to make decisions.

                  When  briefly testing with different users, it was revealed a number of good and bad aspects of the design. On one hand, the app design is very consistent with other apps on market so users were able to navigate efficiently throughout the app. Users were also happy with the layout of certain elements, however, the users had no control or freedom due to there being no way to progress to the next screen or previous screens. It was also noted that the buttons would be too hard and small to read if intoxicated.

                  Users liked the layout of the app, however, it was very similar to an already existing app on the market, Uber.  On the Vehicle Type Screen, one user asked why anyone would choose any car but the one that would arrive earliest. It was argued that that some users like to take their time by continuing to drink/hang out while scheduling for a later pickup. Another issue was that some participants add trouble progressing to the next screen since there was no confirm button on the destination and vehicle type screen. Furthermore users were stuck on one screen because there was no cancel or back button. One user had trouble understanding the ‘location service’ feature when notified so we had to intervene and explain to them.

</p><p>
Through the addition of extra confirmation screens as well as the accompaniment of back buttons and hamburger menus on important screens, all users were able to freely navigate the app and successfully order an autonomous car.

The location services features acts differently than the prototype. Once logging in, the user is faced with a loading screen that find the location of the user. A notification drops down if the user’s location service setting is turned off notifying the user. Users can change their location anytime on the destination screen
